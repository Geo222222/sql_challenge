# 🧾 SQL Challenge – Employee Database Analysis

## 🧠 Overview

This project explores an employee database from a fictional company, Pewlett Hackard. Using PostgreSQL, we perform **data modeling**, **data engineering**, and **data analysis** to understand employee records from the 1980s and 1990s. This challenge demonstrates your SQL schema design, data importation, and complex querying skills.

## 📂 Project Structure


---

## 🧱 Part 1: Data Modeling

- Reviewed 6 CSV files
- Designed an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) outlining table relationships
- Defined primary and foreign key constraints

---

## 🗃️ Part 2: Data Engineering

- Created SQL schema with properly ordered table creation scripts
- Defined data types and constraints
- Imported CSVs into PostgreSQL using `COPY` commands or SQLAlchemy

---

## 🔍 Part 3: Data Analysis

### Example Queries:
- Employees hired in 1986
- Managers and their departments
- Employees in Sales and Development
- Gender and salary breakdowns
- Frequency of last names

Results were retrieved using raw SQL and Pandas DataFrames for additional exploration in Python.

---

## 📊 Insights

- Identified hiring patterns
- Mapped department headcounts
- Analyzed salary distributions by gender and department

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Automate schema creation and data ingestion via Python scripts
- Add stored procedures or views for frequent queries
- Visualize results in a dashboard (e.g., Tableau or Power BI)
